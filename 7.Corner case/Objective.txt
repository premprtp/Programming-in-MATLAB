Write a function called corners that takes a matrix as an input argument and returns four outputs:
	the elements at its four corners in this order:
		top_left,top_right,bottom_left and bottom_right


note:the loops and if-statements are neither necessary nor allowed.

>>[a, b, c, d] = corners([1 2; 3 4])
a=1
b=2
c=3
d=4
