Write a function called taxi_fare that computes the fare of a taxi ride. It takes two inputs:
	the distance in kilometers(d) and the amount of wait time in minutes(t).

The fare is calculated like this:
	the first km is $5
	Every additional km is $2
	and every minute of eaiting is $0.25.

Once a km is started, it counts as a whole (Hint: consider the ceil bulit-in function).The same rule applies to wait times.
You can assume that d>0 and t>=0 but they are not necessarily integers. the function returns the fatein dollars.
For example, a3.5-km ride with 2.25 minutes of watir costs $11.75. Note that loops and if-statements are neither necessary nor allowed.
